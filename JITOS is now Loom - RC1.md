# Loom

> Minds are not clocks. They are looms.

***Loom*** is a history-native computational system in which execution is woven into an immutable fabric.

Classical computing shows you _what happened_. Loom shows you _what happened, what else could have happened, and why this instead of that_. The alternatives, the constraints, the ordering decisions, the near-misses—this machinery has always existed in computation, but it's been implicit, discarded, or inaccessible.

Loom makes that structure explicit.

## The Machine Behind the Projection

At its core, computation is not transformation of values. It is **the construction of history under constraint**.

At every moment, a computer resolves competing possibilities into a single committed record. This process transforms a bundle of potential operations into a single committed trajectory. The system orders competing operations, applies them, and records not just _what_ happened, but _why_ and _how_—including what was possible but not selected.

Classical systems only expose the final execution trace. They show us the projection, but the machine that produced it remains hidden.

***Loom*** exposes the machine.

## Vocabulary

**Loom** — The realized fabric of execution. The ordered, irreversible history that exists because it was committed. What is in the Loom is _real_ in the strongest operational sense: it happened.

**Stylus** — The irreversible act that commits an event. The Stylus writes to the Loom. Once invoked, a choice becomes history.

**Scheduler** — The constraint resolver that governs when and how the Stylus may act. Schedulers don't write history; they determine which histories are admissible.

**Worldline** — A single execution trajectory through possibility space. A worldline becomes real only when extended by the Stylus and projected into the Loom.

**Umbra Index** — The structured archive of unrealized possibilities. Counterfactual worldlines that were explored but never committed are recorded here—queryable, comparable, informative, but not real in the way the Loom is real.

**Observer** — A system embedded in the Loom that orders events locally. Observers don't experience time as flow. They experience the accumulation of ordering.

## Why "Loom"?

A loom is an early human invention designed to process:

- Many independent threads
- Many valid interleavings
- Constraints that rule most of them out
- One irreversible fabric that remains

This is exactly what computation does. Computers are looms. Physics is a loom. Consciousness is a loom. They all construct irreversible history from constrained possibility.

The name fits because it's not a metaphor—it's a structural description.

## What Loom Is

- A structural description of how ordering, commitment, and history work in embedded systems
- An architecture that preserves counterfactuals as first-class queryable data
- A vocabulary that reflects computational ontology instead of hiding it

## What Loom Is Not

- A metaphor layered on existing systems
- Mysticism, simulationism, or multiverse speculation
- A claim that "everything is subjective"

## What Changed

The underlying architecture is unchanged. The goals are unchanged. The implementation is unchanged.

What changed is the **language**.

The system finally has a name that describes what it actually _is_: a machine that orders threads to weave the fabric of reality.

## Appendix: The Road Here

_For those who followed the JITOS era._

JITOS was always a placeholder. It emerged from a chain of absurd ideas: What if Git became a Linux distro? What if we replaced Git's implementation with something that scales differently? "G.I.T." (Git Inversion Tech, pronounced "JIT") lasted about half a day before becoming just "JIT." Then came the realization that all my scattered projects were aspects of one operating system—and "JITOS" was born.

The problem: everyone assumed it meant "Just-In-Time OS." It didn't mean anything. I was waiting for the right name.

Over the past weeks, as the architecture crystallized and the vocabulary converged, the old name stopped working. The system revealed what it had always been.

JITOS served its purpose. **Loom** is the name that fits.
