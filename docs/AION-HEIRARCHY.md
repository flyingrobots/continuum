OK I think we need to set down the AIΩN "Table of Contents" and go recursively deep into exhaustion. Pretend there's an AIΩN Compendium (because there literally is, about 600 pages long so far)

Here's the Table of Contents, recursively:

# What is AIΩN?
The brand.
Term used to reference the "stack" and group of related concepts.
There's layers to this:

-  Layers that have
	- Concepts that have
		- Projects that have
			- Git repos that have code that make
				- Artifacts

Let's define AIΩN piece by piece.

| Layer | What Lives Here |
| ----- | --------------- |
| L0    | Concepts        |
| L1    | Projects        |
| L2    | Git Repos       |
| L3    | Artifacts       |
# [L0] AIΩN
These represent Top-Level Concepts. 
Root-level. 

To organize them, I will give them identifiers. These Layer Zero "concepts" are henceforth referenced by identifiers for the form: `[CX]` where "C" means "Concept" and "X" is just a number.
## [C1] STARTER PACK
The pitch. 
The Executive Summary. 
People Start Here.

## [C2] CΩMPUTER 
The Metaphor. 
The Story. 
This explains *what* and the *why*. 
It describes the concepts of the model. 

When we talk about "classic" computers, this is the opposite of that. CΩMPUTER is the time machine. In an abstract sense, it's the name for the concept of a "new computer", the "new machine". That's CΩMPUTER.
## [C3] JITOS 
The CΩMPUTER's Operating System. 
The  *how*.
The concrete implementation of CΩMPUTER.
## [C4] CΩDEX 
The *theory* of AIΩN and CΩMPUTER.
The math lives here. 
A glossary. 
Extreme academic articles. 
Formal shit.

# [L1] PROJECTS
To group them by Concept, Projects will have their own identifiers. They will be of the form `CX.Y` , where `CX` if the Concept the Project belongs to, and `Y` is just a unique identifier.

### [C1.1] WHITE PAPER

A report that acts as a guide to AIΩN and explains 
- The problem: Computers Are Fundamentally Broken
	- The "original sin" of computing – mutable state.
		- AI blackbox
		- No provenance
		- Loss of work
		- Redundant computation
	- "Desk job computer" ill-suited for a concurrent world
		- Breaks down as soon as you have two users
		- Does not scale
	- Scientific Reproducibility
		- Fraud
		- Missing steps
		- Incomplete records
	- Concurrency Issues
		- Heisenbugs
		- Races
		- Deadlocks
		- Locking in general
	- Not quantum-compatible
		- Fundamentally irreconcilable with quantum computing
- What is a CΩMPUTER?
	- RMG
		- Nodes = State + Provenance
		- DPO Transforms
	- Computation = Storage
	- The Geometry of Computing
		- RMG Wormholes
		- Computational Holography
		- Time cone
		- Rulial Space
		- NP Collapse
	- Deterministic
		- No Heisenbugs
		- Glass box
		- Solves AI
		- 100% Auditable
	- Concurrency by Construction
		- No need for locks
		- Races are impossible
	- Quantum-ready 
		- RMG is 1:1 ZX Calculus
		- Provenance Graph = Q-State Derivations
		- Unitary Evolution = Graph Rewriting
		- Measurement = SWS Collapse
		- No-Cloning Respected
		- Unitary = RMG Reversibility
		- PSpace Collapse = Knowledge Furnace 
			- Computing becomes a Look Up problem
- What is JITOS?
	- Causal Operating System
	- The **final** operating system (hence the "Ω")
	- The _how_ to build a CΩMPUTER
	- Based on how the universe itself works
		- The Universe is a CΩMPUTER running Q-JITOS

The AIΩN website. Yeah I wish we had AION.com or something, but this is the domain I have. We're stuck with it for now.
