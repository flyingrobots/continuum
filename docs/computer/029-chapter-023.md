## Domain-Specific RMGs (Physics, Biology, Logic)

> When Every Discipline Is Just a Rewrite System in Drag

Up to this point we’ve treated RMGs as a universal substrate — the underlying fabric from which computation, geometry, and physics all emerge. But the real magic happens when you zoom into specific domains. Suddenly the abstract becomes concrete, and every scientific field reveals itself as a special case of the same ontological engine.

This chapter gives the reader a hard jolt of recognition:
physics is a domain-specific RMG, biology is a domain-specific RMG, logic is a domain-specific RMG, and so is everything else.

No exceptions.

Once you see the world this way, you can’t unsee it.

### 1. What Makes a Domain-Specific RMG?

A Domain-Specific RMG (DS-RMG) is:

- an RMG whose rewrite rules encode the “laws” of a given domain,
- whose constraints enforce the domain’s invariants,
- whose curvature reflects the domain’s geometry,
- and whose stable subgraphs represent the phenomena that domain studies.

Physics = specific rule families.
Biology = specific rule families with selective pressures.
Logic = specific rewrite constraints defining provability.

And each DS-RMG is a patch on the grand MRMW manifold.

The same underlying ontology.
Different local physics.

### 2. DS-RMG #1: Physics

The Original Rewrite Machine

The universe is, to first approximation, an RMG where:

- nodes are physical configurations
- edges are allowable transitions
- DPO rules encode local causal interactions
- curvature arises from constraint propagation
- stable subgraphs are conserved quantities
- rewrite bundles produce quantum superposition
- and measurement collapses rewrite branches into a single worldline

This is not metaphor.
It is isomorphism.

Classical mechanics emerges when rewrite curvature is low and rules are deterministic.
Quantum mechanics emerges when rewrite bundles are wide and constraints collapse them.
General relativity emerges when curvature is non-uniform across the manifold.
Thermodynamics emerges from the combinatorics of rewrite congestion.

Physics is the canonical DS-RMG, and the physical laws we observe are simply the rule set of our local cosmic patch.

Rewriting is physics.
Physics is rewriting.

The rest of the sciences are echoes.

### 3. DS-RMG #2: Biology

Life as Rewrite Systems Under Selective Pressure

Biology is where RMGs get weird—in a good way.

If physics is the base RMG, biology is a higher-order RMG riding on top of it.
Its rules include:

- replication
- mutation
- selection
- self-reference
- homeostasis
- emergent constraints
- information-bearing structures

These are rewrites acting on rewrites.
A recursion on the RMG toolkit itself.

A gene is a stable subgraph.
A cell is a rewrite-bounded pocket universe.
An organism is a massively parallel rewrite manifold maintaining constraints.
A population is a multiversal bundle of nearby worldlines under divergent selective curvature.

Evolution is literally:

```math
\text{Selection Pressure} = -\nabla_R \Phi_{\text{fitness}}
```

The environment defines the potential field.
Organisms follow gradient descent.
Successful subgraphs survive.

Biology is physics with feedback.
DS-RMG #2 exposes that life is not an exception but an intensification of universal rewrite law.

### 4. DS-RMG #3: Logic

Proof Systems as Rewrite Constraint Machines

Logic is the cleanest DS-RMG in terms of structure:

- propositions are nodes
- inference rules are rewrites
- proofs are worldlines
- consistency is curvature neutrality
- contradictions are negative curvature collapse points
- semantics are stability conditions
- non-termination = infinite worldlines
- normal forms are stable attractors

A logical proof is a path in a rewrite universe whose objective is to reach a stable subgraph representing a theorem.

#### Gödel’s incompleteness?
A region of the RMG where local curvature cannot be flattened globally.

#### Curry-Howard?
A direct isomorphism between two DS-RMGs (logic and computation) with different constraints.

#### Modal logics?
RMGs with extra curvature channels.

#### Probabilistic logics?
RMGs with width-weighted rewrite bundles.

Logic, seen properly, is not about truth—it’s about allowed rewrites.

### 5. Four Other DS-RMGs Worth Naming

To reveal the generality of the frame

We will expand these later in the formal appendix:

- Economics → agents as rewrite regions, markets as constraint fields
- Neuroscience → synaptic rewrites under plasticity curvature
- Sociology → multi-agent RMGs with high-dimensional constraint layers
- Machine Learning → parameter manifolds as rewrite-influenced curvature surfaces

Every discipline has a rewrite ontology.
Most just haven’t admitted it yet.

### 6. Domain Interfaces: The Crucial Insight

The real power emerges when DS-RMGs are composable via spans.

A physics RMG and a biology RMG can interface through energy/matter constraints.
A biology RMG and a logic RMG can interface through cognitive structure.
A machine learning RMG and a logic RMG can interface through invariants.
A physics RMG and a computation RMG can interface through measurement.

This is the missing meta-scientific glue.
Without a unified substrate, you can’t fuse different fields formally.

RMGs solve that.

There is only one mathematics under all these domains:
graphs, rules, constraints, curvature, and worldlines.

Everything else is dialect.

### 7. Why DS-RMGs Matter for CΩMPUTER

The runtime doesn’t operate in some abstract nowhere.
It will be called to simulate domains:

- physics simulations
- biological processes
- logical inference engines
- cognitive models
- agent-based systems
- formal program behavior

Without DS-RMGs, the runtime is universal but useless.
With DS-RMGs, the runtime becomes a general-purpose engine for simulating reality, natural and artificial.

This is where CΩMPUTER transitions from theory to applied omnidisciplinarity.
