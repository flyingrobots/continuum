### Echo

**Echo** (concept)

A core principle of JITOS: every event in the system carries an echo of what came before it.

An "echo" is:

- a collapsed trace of previous state,
- a durable imprint of change,
- a unit in the temporal ordering of reality.

Echo manifests in:

- the WAL (each entry is an echo of a prior universe state),  
- snapshots (each new snapshot is an echo of its ancestors),  
- provenance (ideas and reasoning preserved as echoes),  
- replay (echo chains reconstruct past worlds),  
- synchronization (foreign DAGs enter as echoed structures).

Echo is both:

- an architectural principle, and  
- the philosophical stance that **time is not a number, but the pattern of what the system remembers.**
